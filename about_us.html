                        Suka Dessert is owned by Siti Hajar Mohd Razali, also known as Auntie Ja. Her business gained significant attention through social media. 
                        Starting from her backyard with limited space, she served a small number of guests. Today, she owns a full-fledged dessert shop that can accommodate many customers 
                        and offer a wide selection of sweets displayed in a refrigerated dessert showcase.
